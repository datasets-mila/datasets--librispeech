About this resource
*******************

LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English
speech, prepared by Vassil Panayotov with the assistance of Daniel Povey. The
data is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been
carefully segmented and aligned.  Acoustic models, trained on this data set,
are available at `kaldi-asr.org
<http://www.kaldi-asr.org/downloads/build/6/trunk/egs/>`__ and language models,
suitable for evaluation can be found at http://www.openslr.org/11/.

For more information, see the paper "LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public
domain audio books", Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey and Sanjeev
